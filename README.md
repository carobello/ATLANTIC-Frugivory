# ATLANTIC
A plant-frugivore interactions dataset for the Atlantic Forest, Brazil.
This dataset is a compilation of 8674 frugivory interactions reported for the Atlantic Forest biome, SE Brazil. The data set includes interaction of 328 animal species (232 birds, 90 mammals, 5 fish, 3 reptiles, 1 amphibian) with 787 plant species. In most cases, the records are for plant-frugivore interactions where fruit consumption and handling may end up on actual seed dispersal for the plant, yet illustrating ample variation between the extremes of mutualistic and antagosnistic (e.g., pulp consumption) interactions. In addition, the dataset includes trait information on fruit characteristics (fruit and seed size, colour), and frugivores (body mass and gape size, i.e., width of bill at the commissures).

The dataset accompanies our Data Paper to be published in _Ecology_:

#### C. Data set description

The dataset includes 8674 seed dispersal interactions (records of pairwise interactions between plant and frugivore species partners) reported for the Atlantic Forest biome in Brazil. The data set includes interaction of 331 animal species (232 birds, 90 mammals, 5 fish, 1 amphibian, 3 reptiles) with 787 plant species. We also present trait information directly related to the seed dispersal process such as the size of fruits and seeds, and the body mass and gape size of frugivores. Data were extracted from 173 published and unpublished sources from 1961 to 2016. While this likely is the most comprehensive data set available for a tropical ecosystem, it is arguably biased taxonomically and geographically. The plant families more represented are the Melastomataceae, Myrtaceae, Moraceae, Urticaceae and Solanaceae. _Myrsine coriacea_, _Alchornea glandulosa_, _Cecropia pachystachya_,  and _Trema micrantha_ are the species with more animal dispersers (83, 76, 76 and 74 species, respectively), although _Euterpe edulis_ is the species most mentioned in the studies (367 times). Birds presented the highest interactions reported (3883) followed by mammals (1315). The woolly spider monkey _Brachyteles arachnoides_ and rufous-bellied thrush _Turdus rufiventris_ are the frugivore species with the most diverse fruit diet (137 and 121 plant species, respectively). We also identify that large seeds (>12 mm) are mainly dispersed by terrestrial mammals (rodents, ungulates, primates and carnivores), and that birds are the main consumers of fruits with high concentration of lipids. Our dataset is geographically constrained, with more interactions recorded for the southeast of the Atlantic Forest, which reflects the concentration of studies.
